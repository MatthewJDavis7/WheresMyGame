#Reflection
- Design Choices: I chose to go with EJS for my frontend framework because I was struggling to get React to work so I went back to what I was most comfortable with.
- Challenges: As stated above I was really struggling with React and I managed to fix this issue easily by swapping to EJS.
- Learning Outcomes: I learned that deploying is not as hard as I thought it could have been. I also learned new ways to style a frontend through this project.
- Future Work: I would like to learn how to add a dark mode option to the website.
